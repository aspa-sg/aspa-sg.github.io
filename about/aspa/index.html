<p>The Association of Singapore Patent Attorneys (ASPA) consists of members who are engaged in patent work in Singapore and registered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) as patent attorneys, as well as members who are undergoing training to qualify as patent attorneys.</p>

<p>ASPA aspires to promote and enhance the  patent attorney profession in Singapore. We aim to do this by promoting and encouraging acceptable minimum standards of quality work, integrity and conduct.</p>

<p>In particular, we are active in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>promoting the education and training of patent attorneys and patent trainees;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assisting in the institution and introduction of practice, procedure, training and legislation concerning patents;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establishing rules, directives and a code of conduct pertaining to the profession of patent attorneys; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>engaging in activities and reciprocal co-operation with other associations, national and international.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>ASPA has the support of IPOS and is working closely with the IP Academy to train patent attorneys and other IP specialists to achieve the above objectives.</p>

<h2 id="representing-singapore-patent-attorneys">Representing Singapore Patent Attorneys</h2>

<p>ASPA is recognised by the authorities in Singapore as representative of the patent attorney profession in this country.</p>

<p>In order to further the interests of the profession, ASPA also engages regularly with other organisations in the field of intellectual property around the world.</p>

<p>These include the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys (CIPA), the Japanese Patent Attorneys Association (JPAA) and the Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia (IPTA).</p>

<h1 id="brief-history-of-aspa">Brief History of ASPA</h1>

<p>ASPA was founded in February 2002 by Tan Tee Jim, Murgiana Haq and Tan Kee Leng, a group of lawyers working in the IP field in Singapore.</p>

<p>The pro-tem committee also included Adam Bogsch, Alban Kang, Lee Ai Ming and Jo-Ann See.</p>

<p>ASPA was founded as the Association of Singapore Patent Agents, but was renamed in May 2014 as the Association of Singapore Patent Attorneys.</p>
