          <li>
            <p>assisting in the institution and introduction of practice, procedure, training and legislation concerning patents;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>establishing rules, directives and a code of conduct pertaining to the profession of patent attorneys; and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>engaging in activities and reciprocal co-operation with other associations, national and international.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>ASPA has the support of IPOS and is working closely with the IP Academy to train patent attorneys and other IP specialists to achieve the above objectives.</p>
        <h2 id="representing-singapore-patent-attorneys">Representing Singapore Patent Attorneys</h2>
        <p>ASPA is recognised by the authorities in Singapore as representative of the patent attorney profession in this country.</p>
        <p>In order to further the interests of the profession, ASPA also engages regularly with other organisations in the field of intellectual property around the world.</p>
        <p>These include the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys (CIPA), the Japanese Patent Attorneys Association (JPAA) and the Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia (IPTA).</p>
