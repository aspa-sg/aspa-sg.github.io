          <p>The Asian Patent Attorneys Association (APAA) 17th General Assembly 64th and 65th Council Meetings were held recently in Okinawa, Japan. Several members of ASPA’s Executive Committee attended this meeting.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>During the meeting, we took the opportunity to make contact with members of the International Liaison Committee of the UK Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys.</p>

<p>CIPA’s International Liaison Committee is responsible for co-operation with sister institutes in countries outside Europe, including the organisation of meetings between delegates of CIPA with representatives of overseas bodies both in the UK and abroad.</p>

<p>We are pleased to make contact with CIPA and are actively exploring the possibility of joint events between CIPA and ASPA.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.cipa.org.uk/20CI-3XB55-58E6171L5B/cr.aspx">CIPA’s Christmas Newsletter 2015</a> features a writeup on the meeting with ASPA:</p>

<p>“Members of CIPA’s International Liaison Committee have also met with senior members of patent and trade mark attorney institutes from Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia.</p>

<p>A delegation from CIPA’s International Liaison Committee, led by Chairman Richard Mair, visited Japan as observers at the Asian Patent Attorneys Association’s General Assembly. While at the event, in Okinawa, Richard and the group met attorneys from sister institutes from around the Pacific Rim to reinforce the benefits of working with the UK profession…</p>

<p>“While at APAA we took the opportunity to meet with sister institutes that we would otherwise find difficulty in visiting due to budgets and distances involved,” said Richard.</p>

<p>“The meetings with our Australian and Taiwanese colleagues have become annual fixtures. This year we also held preliminary meetings with institutes in Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia. So I was pleased to continue strengthening existing relations and to be able to develop new ones.”</p>
